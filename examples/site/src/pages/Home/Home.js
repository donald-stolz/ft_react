        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for
        building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community
        of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in
        the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React
        applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state
        management, routing, and interaction with an API.
